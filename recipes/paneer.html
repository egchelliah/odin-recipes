    <p>Paneer masala is a spicy and creamy dish from the north of India. Cubes of cottage cheese, are simmered in a tomato based sauce, with aromatic spice. It is typically accompanied by a side of rice or naan.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Paneer</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>

        <li>Cumin</li>
        <li>Red Chilli</li>
        <li>Coriander Seed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Toast the whole spices (cumin, red chilli, coriander) on a dry skillet, until they are aromatic. Once they start to smell, put them in spice grinder and grind it to a powder. </li>
        <li>Peel the ginger and garlic, and add them to a blender or food processor, with some olive oil and grind to a paste.</li>
        <li>Heat a pan with ghee, then add the onions. Cook until the onions turn translucent and look a little caramelized.</li>
        <li>Add the paste of ginger and garlic, and continuing cooking until the paste turns brown and the raw smell is cooked out. </li>
        <li>Add the spice powder mix, and cook for a few mins without burning</li>
        <li>Add the can of tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes.</li>
        <li>One the tomatoes have stewed for a few mins, add the cubes of paneer. Let this stew for a few mins, so the paneer absorbs the flavor.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat off, pour in the cream, and garnish with cilantro.</li>
        <li>Serve with a bowl of white rice or naan</li>
